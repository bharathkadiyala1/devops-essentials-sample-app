test


To conclude, this year I was able to effectively and efficiently play my part in the success of AmeriCAD. I was able to put my leadership skills and problem - solving skills to use and avoid situations which would have otherwise act as a blocker in the day-to-day operations. I managed to balance my time in a way that I was able to help my team and also find time to complete my tasks. I was able to portray my skillsets through leadership, communication skills, creativity, productivity, teamwork, and driving efficiency.  From creating automated workflows to streamlining data, I have demonstrated my ability to be relied on for various projects. I have deeper understanding on the leading technology services like Airflow, AWS Glue, Redshift, and AWS S3 and have put efforts to use my knowledge to the best. I have gone above and beyond to help the Delloite team in data lineage. Putting this together, I have given my best to prove myself as a really good fit for the position of AWS Developer and shown the potential to be promoted. Considering all my achievements and efforts this year, I would also like to ask for a 15% hike in my pay.



This year, I demonstrated the following work etiquette  Problem Solving- ability:  I worked on AWS-FSC Integration and migrated the on-prem services to Cloud. I have been able to solve various issues which in-turn helped to complete the day-to-day tasks. I have actively demonstrated  analytical and problem-solving skills and together with team efforts, made AmeriCAD a success.   Leadership : Along with taking the lead on projects and delegation tasks to my team, I also enjoyed to stay involved. This helped me to inspire my team by showing that I’m working hands-on to help them, too.
